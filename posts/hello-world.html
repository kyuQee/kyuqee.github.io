    <div><h1 id="hello-world"><strong>HELLO WORLD</strong>.</h1>
<h1 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h1>
<p>I'm a 16-year-old aspiring to break into CS/AI and quantitative finance, but what really matters is that- 
I'm simply someone who has grown to love graphs and data, and the idea of information and analysis.</p>
<h1 id="where-im-coming-from">Where I'm coming from:</h1>
<p>I've been coding (ashamed to call it programming) since I was 11, though I often struggled to see projects through to completion. It wasn't for a lack of ideas- it was a lack of <strong>discipline</strong>. 
To illustrate the challenges I faced, here are some of my past projects:</p>
<h2 id="project-nosea">Project: NoSea</h2>
<p>This was an overly ambitious one for sure-</p>
<h3 id="the-idea">The Idea:</h3>
<p>I wanted to make an <strong>operating system (OS) all by myself</strong>... Sounds pretty stupid, right? 
Well it wasn't just another "Ubuntu reskin", I wanted to write the kernel and all, by myself. From scratch. <br />
My thoughts back then went something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we could have a lightweight, open-source, multi-platform OS (For mobile and PCs), that was the exact same on both platforms (unlike Linux, and android which is based on linux but basically completely different), it would be <strong>"THE NEXT BIG THING"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="resources">Resources:</h3>
<p>Although my project itself wasn't useful at all the resources I used, were.<br />
So here are some of them for reference (I can't find all of them as I deleted the repo, and the files. I wasn't logging any of my activities so I can only rely on my memory for this-).    </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M">Write Your Own Operating System (Youtube)</a>: Teaches most of the fundamental and gives an idea about the true complexity of it all. But it's pretty old now, still mostly how systems work- but pretty old.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SeZRitx5MjBKzTtvk0pHMtp">Write Your Own 64-bit Operating System (Youtube - CodePulse)</a>: This is where I made my first mistake. It is a really good example, but I followed it blindly at first, doing exactly what he was without understand the <em>WHY?</em> and the underlying theory. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3B56ql_akNcvH8vvJRYOc7TbYhRs19M">Making an OS(x86)</a>: Again a really good resource... but I found it later- after I had nearly given up.   </li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page">OSDEV wiki</a>: Literally the Bible for OS dev. Back then, I didnt really understand all the computer stuff and didn't put in enough effort to learn... so I was really confused. Looking back now I can see why it's so highly regarded. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-plan">The Plan:</h3>
<p>I didn't have a solid plan at first and ended up failing about 5 or 6 times. (An OS as my first big project was a REALLY BAD idea.) But after all those mess-ups and way too much pondering when I should've been studying, I came up with something. (I'm writing this now, so it's all from memory-I might've made it a bit better by accident, but I've tried to keep the original idea, flaws included.)</p>

<p>[
    If you're seeing this- it means I couldn't meet the deadline (01/04/2025), and am too busy/lazy to finish the whole thing. I may update it in the future, but right now my current projects take priority. I hope whatever is written atleast gave you a rough idea about me.
