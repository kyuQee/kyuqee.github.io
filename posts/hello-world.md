# **HELLO WORLD**.   

# Who am I?
I'm a 16-year-old aspiring to break into CS/AI and quantitative finance, but what really matters is that- 
I'm simply someone who has grown to love graphs and data, and the idea of information and analysis.

# Where I'm coming from:    
I've been coding since I was 11, though I often struggled to see projects through to completion. It wasn't for a lack of ideas- it was a lack of **discipline**. 
To illustrate the challenges I faced, here are some of my past projects:
## Project: NoSea   
This was an overly ambitious one for sure-
### The Idea:   
I wanted to make an **operating system (OS) all by myself**... Sounds pretty stupid, right? 
Well it wasn't just another "Ubuntu reskin", I wanted to write the kernel and all, by myself. From scratch.   
My thoughts back then went something like:

> If we could have a lightweight, open-source, multi-platform OS (For mobile and PCs), that was the exact same on both platforms (unlike Linux, and android which is based on linux but basically completely different), it would be **"THE NEXT BIG THING"**

### Resources:  
Although my project itself wasn't useful at all the resources I used were not.  
So here are some of them for reference (I can't find all of them as I deleted the repo, and the files. I wasn't logging any of my activities so I can only rely on my memory for this-).    

1. [Write Your Own Operating System (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M): Teaches most of the fundamental and gives an idea about the true complexity of it all. But it's pretty old now, still mostly how systems work- but pretty old.
2. [Write Your Own 64-bit Operating System (Youtube - CodePulse)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SeZRitx5MjBKzTtvk0pHMtp): This is where I made my first mistake. It is a really good example, but I followed it blindly at first, doing exactly what he was without understand the _WHY?_ and the underlying theory. 
3. [Making an OS(x86)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3B56ql_akNcvH8vvJRYOc7TbYhRs19M): Again a really good resource... but I found it later- after I had nearly given up.   
4. [OSDEV wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page): Literally the Bible for OS dev. Back then, I didnt really understand all the computer stuff and didn't put in enough effort to learn... so I was really confused. Looking back now I can see why it's so highly regarded. 


### The Plan:
I didn't have a solid plan at first and ended up failing about 5 or 6 times. (An OS as my first big project was a REALLY BAD idea.) But after all those mess-ups and way too much pondering when I should've been studying, I came up with something. (I'm writing this now, so it's all from memory-I might've made it a bit better by accident, but I've tried to keep the original idea, flaws included.)
