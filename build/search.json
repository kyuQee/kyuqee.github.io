It wasn't for a lack of ideas- it was a lack of <strong>discipline</strong>. \nTo illustrate the challenges I faced, here are some of my past projects:</p>\n<h2>Project: NoSea</h2>\n<p>This was an overly ambitious one for sure-</p>\n<h3>The Idea:</h3>\n<p>I wanted to make an <strong>operating system (OS) all by myself</strong>... Sounds pretty stupid, right? \nWell it wasn't just another \"Ubuntu reskin\", I wanted to write the kernel and all, by myself. From scratch. <br />\nMy thoughts back then went something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we could have a lightweight, open-source, multi-platform OS (For mobile and PCs), that was the exact same on both platforms (unlike Linux, and android which is based on linux but basically completely different), it would be <strong>\"THE NEXT BIG THING\"</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Resources:</h3>\n<p>Although my project itself wasn't useful at all the resources I used were not.<br />\nSo here are some of them for reference (I can't find all of them as I deleted the repo, and the files. I wasn't logging any of my activities so I can only rely on my memory for this-).    </p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M\">Write Your Own Operating System (Youtube)</a>: Teaches most of the fundamental and gives an idea about the true complexity of it all. But it's pretty old now, still mostly how systems work- but pretty old.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SeZRitx5MjBKzTtvk0pHMtp\">Write Your Own 64-bit Operating System (Youtube - CodePulse)</a>: This is where I made my first mistake. It is a really good example, but I followed it blindly at first, doing exactly what he was without understand the <em>WHY?</em> and the underlying theory. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3B56ql_akNcvH8vvJRYOc7TbYhRs19M\">Making an OS(x86)</a>: Again a really good resource... but I found it later- after I had nearly given up.   </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page\">OSDEV wiki</a>: Literally the Bible for OS dev. Back then, I didnt really understand all the computer stuff and didn't put in enough effort to learn... so I was really confused. Looking back now I can see why it's so highly regarded. </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Plan:</h3>\n<p>I didn't have a solid plan at first and ended up failing about 5 or 6 times. (An OS as my first big project was a REALLY BAD idea.) But after all those mess-ups and way too much pondering when I should've been studying, I came up with something. (I'm writing this now, so it's all from memory-I might've made it a bit better by accident, but I've tried to keep the original idea, flaws included.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/images/NoSea-architecture.png\" style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\"></p>","metadata":{"date":"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","slug":"hello-world","tags":["python","blog"],"title":"Hello World"},"slug":"hello-world"}]}
