It wasn't for a lack of ideas- it was a lack of <strong>discipline</strong>. \nTo illustrate the challenges I faced, here are some of my past projects:</p>\n<h2>Project: NoSea</h2>\n<p>This was an overly ambitious one for sure-</p>\n<h3>The Idea:</h3>\n<p>I wanted to make an <strong>operating system (OS) all by myself</strong>... Sounds pretty stupid, right? \nWell it wasn't just another \"Ubuntu reskin\", I wanted to write the kernel and all, by myself. From scratch. <br />\nMy thoughts back then went something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we could have a lightweight, open-source, multi-platform OS (For mobile and PCs), that was the exact same on both platforms (unlike Linux, and android which is based on linux but basically completely different), it would be <strong>\"THE NEXT BIG THING\"</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Resources:</h3>\n<p>Although my project itself wasn't useful at all the resources I used, were.<br />\nSo here are some of them for reference (I can't find all of them as I deleted the repo, and the files. I wasn't logging any of my activities so I can only rely on my memory for this-).    </p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M\">Write Your Own Operating System (Youtube)</a>: Teaches most of the fundamental and gives an idea about the true complexity of it all. But it's pretty old now, still mostly how systems work- but pretty old.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SeZRitx5MjBKzTtvk0pHMtp\">Write Your Own 64-bit Operating System (Youtube - CodePulse)</a>: This is where I made my first mistake. It is a really good example, but I followed it blindly at first, doing exactly what he was without understand the <em>WHY?</em> and the underlying theory. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3B56ql_akNcvH8vvJRYOc7TbYhRs19M\">Making an OS(x86)</a>: Again a really good resource... but I found it later- after I had nearly given up.   </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page\">OSDEV wiki</a>: Literally the Bible for OS dev. Back then, I didnt really understand all the computer stuff and didn't put in enough effort to learn... so I was really confused. Looking back now I can see why it's so highly regarded. </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Plan:</h3>\n<p>I didn't have a solid plan at first and ended up failing about 5 or 6 times. (An OS as my first big project was a REALLY BAD idea.) But after all those mess-ups and way too much pondering when I should've been studying, I came up with something. (I'm writing this now, so it's all from memory-I might've made it a bit better by accident, but I've tried to keep the original idea, flaws included.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/images/NoSea-architecture-hello-world.png\" class=\"invertible\">  </p>\n<p>[\n    If you're seeing this- it means I couldn't meet the deadline (01/04/2025), and am too busy/lazy to finish the whole thing. I may update it in the future, but right now my current projects take priority. I hope whatever is written atleast gave you a rough idea about me.\n]</p>","metadata":{"date":"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","slug":"hello-world","tags":["python","blog"],"title":"Hello World"},"slug":"hello-world"},{"content_html":"<h1>Introduction:</h1>\n<p>Ever wonder why the weather app says there's heavy rain today, while you're sitting under the burning sun? Me too.  <br />\nApparently it's not as easy as one might imagine, what we have today is borderline magic. <br />\nBut still curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to start this project, to uncover what makes it so challenging and maybe learn something along the way.    </p>\n<hr />\n<h1>But How Does Weather Even Work?</h1>\n<p>I remember the weather related chapters used to be some of the most interesting chapters in geography, back in school. Even more so than the science classes (I'm a science student). It was one of those chapters that just made pure logical sense, without overwhelming the students with math.<br />\nTo better understand the numerical observations, we must first qualitatively understand what weather patterns on Earth actually look like. This part will try to cover as much as possible in a reasonable amount of time. (excuse the use of non-technical terms, it's meant to give an idea without getting into the jargon)  </p>\n<h2>The Basic Mechanics:</h2>\n<h3>Convection:</h3>\n<p>Okay so this is typically common-knowledge, but as a refresher, <strong>hot-air is typically lighter (less dense) than cold-air</strong>. This causes hot air to rise up into the atmosphere, causing a <strong>Vertical wind current</strong>.    </p>\n<h3>Drop In Temperature with Height:</h3>\n<p>The temperature usually drops at the <strong>Normal lapse rate</strong> (i.e 6.5 \u00b0C every 1km).<br />\nOne might deem this as common sense, however, the reason is more nuanced than you might think. The atmosphere actually <strong>cannot absorb incoming energy from the sun</strong>, the <strong>heat supply actually comes from the earth</strong> (as it is radiated back into the atmosphere). The main reason has to do with <strong>long and short waves</strong>, but it would require a lot more context to explain. With this highly simplified line of thinking, one can easily imagine the drop in temperature as we get farther away from the surface.</p>\n<h3>Drop In Pressure with Height:</h3>\n<p>Again this is due to the effects of gravity on air. (treating it as a collection of particles).</p>\n<h3>Pressure Differences Drive Wind:</h3>\n<p>Air always moves from <strong>high pressure to low pressure</strong>. Now this pressure difference may be caused in a number of ways, like, <strong>temperature differences</strong> causing hot air to rise, and leaving behind an area of low pressure, or <strong>high relative humidity</strong>, etc.</p>\n<h3>Water Heats/Cools Faster than Land:</h3>\n<p>This gives rise to daily effects like, <strong>land breeze &amp; sea breeze</strong> (due to temperature differences), as well as yearly effects as we will see ahead.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Mechanics:</h2>\n<h3>The Pressure Belts:</h3>\n<p>There are four kinds of pressure belts on earth:    </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Equitorial <strong>LOW</strong> pressure belt (ITCZ).</li>\n<li>Subtropical <strong>HIGH</strong> pressure belt.</li>\n<li>Subpolar <strong>LOW</strong> pressure belt.</li>\n<li>polar <strong>HIGH</strong> pressure belt.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This image explains it much better than words can:  </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Ideal-Zonal-Pressure-Belts-An-imaginary-uniform-Earth-with-idealized-zonal-continuous_fig3_273949389\"><img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mesut-Demircan/publication/273949389/figure/fig3/AS:669379721187338@1536603970467/Ideal-Zonal-Pressure-Belts-An-imaginary-uniform-Earth-with-idealized-zonal-continuous.ppm\" alt=\"An imaginary uniform Earth with idealized zonal (continuous) pressure belts.\"/></a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In essence however, hot air rises at the equator, and cold air descends at the tropics. Same for subpolar and polar, however this time its more to do with the rotation of the earth driving it. (Explaining the whole mechanism will take too much time for a refresher).<br />\nI would also like to bring your attention to the names of these winds, and their direction, it will be important later.</p>\n<h3>Ocean Currents:</h3>\n<p>There are many so look at this figure instead:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-major-ocean-currents-the-red-arrows-illustrate-warm-water-currents-and-the-blue-are_fig2_264880631\"><img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karin-Thomas/publication/264880631/figure/fig2/AS:295907590459392@1447561275071/The-major-ocean-currents-the-red-arrows-illustrate-warm-water-currents-and-the-blue-are.png\" alt=\"The major ocean currents, the red arrows illustrate warm water currents and the blue are cold water currents.\"/></a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Especially pay attention to the <strong>Peruvian current</strong>. It is infact not a permanent current, it's appearance marks El Nino which will be explored ahead.</p>\n<h3>Rain Shadow &amp; Returning Monsoons:</h3>\n<p>Topological protrusions like mountains can cause significant changes to the local weather. It may block the incoming rain and cause heavy precipitation on the <strong>Windward side</strong>, leaving the other side in <strong>Rain shadow</strong>. \nRain shadow looks something like this:  </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Precipitation-effects-of-moisture-laden-air-passing-over-a-mountain-range-Precipitation_fig6_226689513\"><img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William-Hay-2/publication/226689513/figure/fig6/AS:668988686225415@1536510740573/Precipitation-effects-of-moisture-laden-air-passing-over-a-mountain-range-Precipitation.png\" alt=\"Precipitation effects of moisture-laden air passing over a mountain range. Precipitation occurs on the windward side of the range, and a rain shadow develops in its lee. RH relative humidity\"/></a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Since we will be doing a lot of heatmap-type graphs later here is a more technical version. (shamelessly copy-pasted, you can read the actual paper linked with it).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-Topography-map-and-location-of-the-measurement-sites-in-the-rain-shadow-region-of-the_fig1_374810410\"><img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374810410/figure/fig1/AS:11431281292089982@1732416879462/a-Topography-map-and-location-of-the-measurement-sites-in-the-rain-shadow-region-of-the.png\" alt=\"(a) Topography map and location of the measurement sites in the rain shadow region of the Western Ghats.

When the monsoon hit the <strong>himalayas</strong>, they are <strong>blocked</strong> and unable to pass (again excuse the use of non-technical and inaccurate language), and as the sun slowly moves downward the pressure belts start shifting, and the <strong>low pressure zone over the northern plains gets depleted</strong>. This causes the monsoon winds to <strong>blow backwards</strong> making it seem like they are \"retreating\".</p>\n<h3>El Nino and La Nina:</h3>\n<p>El Nino and La Nina are phases of the <strong>El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</strong>, driven by shifts in sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure across the tropical Pacific. These phases influence global weather patterns, notably the Indian monsoon, by altering wind and moisture flows. The <strong>Peruvian (Humboldt) Current</strong>, a cold ocean current off South America\u2019s coast, plays a key role in these dynamics.</p>\n<h4>El Nino Effects</h4>\n<p>During El Nino, weakened trade winds reduce the westward push of warm water, allowing it to flow back toward South America. This warms the eastern Pacific and suppresses the Peruvian Current\u2019s cold upwelling, disrupting nutrient-rich waters. For India, this often weakens the monsoon circulation, leading to below-average rainfall and potential droughts, as the usual low-pressure system over the subcontinent loses strength.</p>\n<h4>La Nina Effects</h4>\n<p>In La Nina, stronger trade winds drive warm water toward Asia, intensifying the Peruvian Current\u2019s cold upwelling along South America. This cools the eastern Pacific, enhancing atmospheric stability there. For India, La Nina strengthens monsoon winds, increasing moisture inflow from the Indian Ocean, often resulting in above-average rainfall, though excessive rain can cause flooding in vulnerable areas.</p>\n<hr />\n<!-- \n# The Old Way: Crunching Numbers\nWay back, predicting weather meant solving big equations-like how fluids move (Navier-Stokes, if you're nerdy). Think of it as slicing the sky into a grid and calculating what happens next. That's numerical weather prediction (NWP). Supercomputers run this for days, tweaking it with real data so it doesn't go off the rails. ERA5, my file, comes from that-past weather re-simulated with today's tech. It's a cheat sheet of what happened in 2024, and I'm using it to jumpstart my own model.\n\nBut here's the catch: those equations are slow, and tiny mistakes explode fast. Chaos, right? That's why I'm not stopping there.\n\n# The New Way: AI's Turn\nThen there's AI. I ran into GenCast-Google's trick from late 2024. It's this crazy model that skips the physics and learns patterns from piles of ERA5 data, spitting out 15-day forecasts in minutes. Wild. Or nowcasting-quick 0-6 hour guesses from radar pics. I'm aiming simpler: a day ahead with a neural network (CNN). Maybe I can nudge it with sparse data later, GenCast-style. It's less \"solve the universe\" and more \"spot the trends\"-faster, scrappier. -->\n\n<h1>Peeking at the Data:</h1>\n<p>So after a few hours of research I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview\"><strong>ERA5</strong></a>, it's probably the best historical dataset available for free. I did consider trying to get IMD data specific to India, but I guess ERA5 is good enough for a prototype. \nThe dataset on its own is probably very huge (~ few Petabytes), so I decided to get only a few months and a few timestamps worth of data from <strong>2024</strong>, i.e, <strong>Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec</strong>. And roughly <strong>4 hour</strong> intervals.<br />\nThe website conviniently provides it's api guide, as well as auto-generation of the api request. <br />\nhere is the code:</p>\n<div
